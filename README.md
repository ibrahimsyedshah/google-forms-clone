**How to use this app**
An account must first be created to sign in. Once signed in, you may view all available forms on the dashboard.
Functionality for adding, removing or editing forms is not present as this would require changes to the oneentry cms, which can only be accessed by the owner (which is myself).
To view the details of a form, click on 'View Details' of the desired form. 
To submit a form, you must use the public link, which can be found once you click 'Send' on the top right. This link can also be sent to anyone else to submit a form.
To view the summary of responses, simply go back to view form details from the dashboard.
